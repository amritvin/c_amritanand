I am a malware analyst, passionate about reverse engineering and automation. My journey in cybersecurity starts with [Amrita](https://www.amrita.edu/center/cyber-security) during my masters in cyber security. 
My likes and hobbies include volunteer activities, blogging and photography apart from programming.
